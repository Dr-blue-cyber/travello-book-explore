# Setting up a Django Project with Virtual Environment

## Install Python and Pip
First, make sure you have Python installed. Pip, the package installer for Python, usually comes with the Python installation.

```bash
$ python --version
$ pip --version
```

## Check Django Version
Verify if Django is available by checking its version.

```bash
$ django-admin --version
```

## Install Virtual Environment
Install `virtualenvwrapper-win` to manage virtual environments easily.

```bash
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
```

## Create Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment using `mkvirtualenv`.

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv test  # create a virtual environment named 'test'
```

### Activate/Deactivate Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment with `workon` and deactivate it with `deactivate`.

```bash
$ workon test  # activate the virtual environment
$ deactivate   # deactivate the virtual environment
```

Alternatively, using the built-in `venv` module:

```bash
$ python -m venv myenv  # create a virtual environment named 'myenv'
$ .\myenv\Scripts\activate  # activate on Windows
$ source myenv/bin/activate  # activate on Unix/MacOS
$ deactivate  # deactivate the virtual environment
```

## Change Execution Policy (Windows)
Change the execution policy for the current session if needed.

```bash
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then try activating the virtual environment again.

```bash
$ .\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

## Django Setup
Install Django using pip.

```bash
$ pip install django
```

## Create Django Project
Create a project folder and initiate a Django project.

```bash
$ django-admin startproject telusko
$ cd telusko
```

## Run Django Server
Navigate to the project folder and run the Django development server.

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. Create a database named 'telusko' using pgAdmin.

## Verify Migrations
Ensure all migrations have been applied to the database.

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

**Note:** Make sure to replace the placeholders like `test`, `myenv`, and `telusko` with your preferred names.
